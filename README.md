This is a GUI designed for Nuke Simulator. It comes with multiple functions that enhance the gameplay experience.
One of its main features is an automatic Silo opener, which is capable of handling up to 3 nukes. You can add more nukes to the Silo if needed.
Additionally, the Auto Farm tab offers an auto-collect function that provides a large magnet radius. You can also auto-equip your best nukes and claim the 4h chest automatically.
The GUI also includes an AntiAFK script that helps prevent players from getting kicked for inactivity. Moreover, there is a script that allows you to change your movement speed under the Misc tab.
Finally, the GUI has a function that calculates the average coin gain for every 60-second time span. This function helps players keep track of their progress and make adjustments to their gameplay strategy.
This GUI was created in little time, and any new ideas or suggestions are welcomed.

I skid a lot of code from other people so don't come to me with "OH YOU USED THAT", I don't give a shit. I made this to learn a bit more about coding and because there wasn't any gui I really liked.
